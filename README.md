# cmpe272_final_project
Final project for cmpe 272

Backend contains a simple hello world express server; node index.js
Frontend contains the default react create page; npm start

Added gitignore file 
    - from now on modules aren't uploaded so you will have to do 'npm i' after pulling to install all the packages the first time or if someone adds a new package you will have to run 'npm i' again
